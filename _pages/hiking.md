## Hiking

### 1. US national parks tier list 
Over the past eight years, I have traveled through 30 states (staying at least one night in each) and visited 32 national parks across the United States. Based on these experiences, I've created a tier list to share my personal ratings of the national parks I've visited. This tier system is deeply personal and subjective, reflecting not an absolute ranking, but rather my own experiences and preferences. Due to time and resource constraints, I haven't been able to explore every aspect of these parks; thus, my rankings are based solely on what I've personally seen and done. Please consider this tier system as a reflection of my own journey through America's national parks, shaped by the landscapes that resonate most deeply with me. As I continue to visit more national parks, I will update this list to reflect those experiences. 

My appreciation for scenery strongly influences my ratings—mountains are my favorite, followed by deserts, then seashores or lakeshores, with caves next, and forests being relatively my least favorite. The scale of the scenery plays a critical role in my evaluations, and the diversity of the landscape is also an important consideration. I also place significant emphasis on the opportunity to observe wildlife. However, factors like park facilities or crowd levels do not weigh heavily in my criteria.
